# Experiments

## MacroData
Process the macro data to find the timing of main shock, to plot the macroscopic shear and normal stress.

## DetectEvent
Find the main stick-slip events and gouge events. We visually pick the gouge events by hands, applying the high-pass filter to improve the detectability of the small events embedded by the noise. See the details in the [readme of the directory](DetectEvent).

## ExperimentalStats
Compute the statistics of the stick-slip experiments.

## GougePatch
Analyze the particle size distribution of the gouge and the topography of the gouge patch.
