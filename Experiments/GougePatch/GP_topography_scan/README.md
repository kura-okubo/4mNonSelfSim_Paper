# GP topography scan
We measured the topography of the gouge patch using the laser displacement sensor (LT-9010M, Keyence, minimum vertical resolution: ~ 10 nm) and moving stage (horizontal resolution = 50 μm). The measurement range is ±200.0 [μm] for ±10V. `GPTOPO-02_001.dat` is the raw continuous data of the LDS, and we convert it to the 2D topography by `code/main_QTtoposcan_GP02.m`. We also compute the spectrum of heterogeneity by `code/evaluate_spectrum_GP02.m`.
