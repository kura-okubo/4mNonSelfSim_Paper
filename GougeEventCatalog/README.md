# Gouge event catalog

Here we generate the gouge event catalog by merging the post-process results. The catalog contains the follows:

1. Event ID
2. location
3. event onset time
4. stick-slip ID
5. foreshock/aftershock label
6. Q correction quartile
7. Nvalidsensors (Number of AE sensors used to estimate source parameters)
8. event magnitude (mean by Nvalidsensors)
9. moment magnitude (mean by Nvalidsensors)
10. source duration (mean by Nvalidsensors)
