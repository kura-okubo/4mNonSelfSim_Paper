# Contents

## [Calibration](./Calibration)
Calibration of AE sensors, sensor coupling factors, and attenuation characteristics of the rock sample to achieve accurate source parameter estimation.

## [ComputeScaling](./ComputeScaling)
Processes AE waveforms generated by gouge patches to estimate source parameters and reveal non-self-similar scaling behavior.

## [Experiments](./Experiments)
Preprocessing of experimental datasets to extract AE waveforms, strain, displacement, and other macroscopic measurements.

## [GougeEventCatalog](./GougeEventCatalog)
Compiles a gouge patch (GP) event catalog containing metadata after estimating source parameters in [ComputeScaling](./ComputeScaling).

## [GougeEventStats](./GougeEventStats)
Analyzes relationships between seismic moment ($M_0$), macroscopic measurements, local slip, and slip velocity.

<!-- ## [LaboratoryNote](./LaboratoryNote) -->

## [Others](./Others)
Auxiliary scripts and resources related to specific subprocesses of the experiment.

## [PlotEvent](./PlotEvent)
Generates master plots of stick-slip events, including shear stress changes and associated AE waveforms.

## [RuptureSimulation](./RuptureSimulation)
Performs dynamic rupture simulations of GP events, including input generation and postprocessing of simulation results.

## [SourceInvFit](./SourceInvFit)
Preliminary source parameter analysis through waveform fitting, conducted prior to [ComputeScaling](./ComputeScaling) for metadata compilation.
