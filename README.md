# Contents

### - [Experiments](Experiments)
Analyze the stick-slip experiments to evaluate the macroscopic data and to detect the gouge patch events.

### - [SourceInvFit](SourceInvFit)
Preliminary analysis to evaluate the source parameters by fitting the P wave form with the numerically modeled waveforms. The Green's function will be used to synthesize the waveforms with the dynamic rupture modeling.

### - [ComputeScaling](ComputeScaling)
Evaluate the seismic moment and source duration to obtain the moment-duration scaling of the gouge patch events.

### - [RuptureSimulation](RuptureSimulation)
Conduct the dynamic rupture simulation using [UGUCA](https://gitlab.com/uguca/uguca) to investigate the source mechanisms of the non-self-similar laboratory earthquakes.

--- 
### - [Calibration](Calibration)
Calibration of the acoustic emission (AE) sensors and the attenuation factor of the rock sample.

### - [Others](Others)
Other materials for supplementary analysis.
